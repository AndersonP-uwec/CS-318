        <h1>About Tigers</h1>
        <p>The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest living cat species and a member of the genus Panthera. It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange fur with a white underside. An apex predator, it primarily preys on ungulates such as deer and wild boar. It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator, requiring large contiguous areas of habitat, which support its requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring. Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years, then become independent and leave their mother's home range to establish their own.</p>
        <p>The tiger is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List. As of 2015, the global wild tiger population was estimated to number between 3,062 and 3,948 mature individuals, with most of the populations living in small isolated pockets. India currently hosts the largest tiger population. Major reasons for population decline are habitat destruction, habitat fragmentation and poaching. Tigers are also victims of human–wildlife conflict, particularly in range countries with a high human population density.</p>
        <h2>Quick Tiger Facts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Tigers are the largest wild cats in the world. Adults can weigh up to 363kg and measure up to 3.3m!</li>
            <li>Tigers are carnivores, eating only meat. They mainly feed on large mammals such as deer, wild pigs, antelope and buffalo.</li>
            <li>Tigers are solitary hunters, and generally search for food alone at night. They quietly stalk their prey until they are close enough to pounce – then they kill their victim with a bite to the neck or back of the head.</li>
            <li>Tigers are good swimmers. Unlike most members of the cat family, they like water and often cool off in pools or streams.</li>
            <li>A tiger’s roar can be heard as far as three kilometres away.</li>
            <li>At full speed, tigers can reach up to 65km/h.</li>
            <li>These fierce felines have walked the earth for a long time. Fossil remains of tigers found in parts of China are believed to be 2 million years old.</li>
            <li>No two tigers have the same stripes. Since every tiger has their own pattern on their fur, they are all unique!</li>
            <li>Today, there are five subspecies of tiger. These subspecies are the Bengal tiger, South China tiger, Indochinese tiger, Sumatran tiger and Amur tiger (also known as Siberian tiger). Sadly, three subspecies of tiger have become extinct – the Caspian, Bali and Javan.</li>
            <li>Less than 100 years ago, tigers could be found throughout Asia. Sadly, hunting and habitat loss have put populations at risk, and today their range has been reduced to around 7% of its former size.</li>
